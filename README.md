# Visualizing Neighbourhood Crime Rates in Toronto

## Overview

Toronto has consistently maintained a low crime rate compared to other major cities. This repository contains the analysis and findings of a study aimed at understanding the trends in crime rates in Toronto over the past decade. The primary objectives include identifying neighborhoods with high crime rates across various categories and exploring the relationship between population density and crime rates.

## Key Findings
