abstract: "Toronto has maintained a low crime rate in comparison to other major cities. This paper endeavors to ascertain whether Toronto exhibits a tendency of becoming more dangerous over time. This study delves into the crime rate trends observed over the past decade, identifying neighborhoods with high crime rates across various crime categories. Additionally, the analysis explores the relationship between population density and crime rates. Upon careful examination, the findings suggest that Toronto is indeed experiencing an increase in overall crime rates but remains relatively safe when compared to other cities. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that there is no direct correlation between population density and crime rates."

# Introduction

Toronto consistently ranks high in assessments of urban safety. In @SafeCitiesIndex2021, Toronto earned the distinction of being the second safest city globally, surpassed only by Copenhagen in the Netherlands. However, despite these rankings, crime rates in Toronto have exhibited an upward trajectory in 2023, notably marked by a significant increase in shootings since 2019. In 2017, with the exception of homicide, all major crime offenses have shown an uptick in reported numbers compared to the corresponding period last year. To gain a holistic understanding of the overall trend in crime rates over the past decade, we have gathered a comprehensive dataset on crime rates in Toronto.

While previous statistics, such as those from @WorstTorontoNeighbourhoodsForCrime, have identified the most dangerous neighborhoods based on total reported crimes, these analyses often lack a nuanced perspective by not considering the population density of each neighborhood. To address this gap and offer a more comprehensive and equitable analysis, our study aims to examine crime rates per density. This approach is crucial for understanding the true impact of crime in different neighborhoods, as it considers the density of the population, providing a fair comparison and allowing for more targeted interventions. By investigating crime rates over time and incorporating population density, our analysis aims to contribute valuable insights for policymakers, law enforcement, and community stakeholders in fostering safer urban environments in Toronto.

# Data

## Data Sourcing

Data used in this paper are retrieved from Open Data Toronto Portal using the library `opendatatoronto` @opendatatoronto. The dataset is provided by @NeighbourhoodCrimeRates.

## Variable of interest

The neighbourhood investigated in this paper is based on the new 158 City of Toronto Neighbourhoods structure. We collected each neighbourhood's population and its respective crime rates across 9 different crime categories, including assault, auto theft, bike theft, break and enter, homicide, robbery, shooting, theft from motor vehicle and theft over \$5000. We analyzed the crime rate data from 2014 to 2023.

## Data Preprocessing

Data was cleaned and analyzed using the open source statistically programming language R (@citeR) , using functionalities from tidyverse (@tidyverse), ggplot2 (@ggplot), dplyr (@dplyr), sf (@sf), sp (@sp) and knitr (@knitr). The crime rates are calculated per 100,000 population for the year using that year's population projection provided by Environics Analytics @EnvironicsAnalytics. A sample of cleaned data of neighbourhood crime rate in 2023 can be viewed in @tbl-1.

# Results

## Overall trend of crime rates

Based on the crime rate data spanning from 2014 to 2023, the majority of crime rate categories have remained relatively stable, with the notable exceptions of assault and auto theft crimes, see @fig-crime-rates-over-time. The data reveals a significant uptick in both categories post-2020 and into 2021. Specifically, from 2014 to 2023, the assault crime rate exhibited a 34% increase, rising from 0.6104 to 0.8063. Concurrently, the auto theft crime rate experienced a substantial surge of 211%, escalating from 0.1229 to 0.3822. Both categories reached its highest levels in 2023.

Furthermore, the analysis underscores assault as the predominant crime in Toronto, recording nearly three times the occurrence of other crime categories. This observation emphasizes the significance of addressing and understanding the dynamics of assault-related incidents within the city.

## Relationship between population density and crime rates

To comprehensively explore the relationship between population density and crime rates on a geographic scale, we generated a heatmap illustrating crime rates across different neighborhoods. This analysis specifically focused on population data from the year 2023 for simplicity. Notably, areas with heightened population density, particularly in downtown and northeast Toronto, were identified as depicted in @fig-toronto-population-density-2023.

Upon scrutinizing the heatmap across various crime categories, there is no clear correlation between population density and specific crime rates, except in the case of bike theft. However, notable patterns are observed in the northwest area, including neighborhoods such as West Humber-Clairville, York University Heights, Downsview, and Oakdale-Beverley Heights, all of which are characterized by high population density. In this region, an elevated occurrence of crime is observed across seven out of nine crime categories. Moreover, bike theft crimes were concentrated in downtown Toronto, aligning with the primary location of the city's bike-sharing program.

## Neighbourhood with the highest crime rate

After analyzing the distribution of crime across various neighborhoods, our focus shifted towards identifying the neighborhood with the highest crime rate in Toronto. The chart in @fig-top-20-area illustrates the average crime rates across the nine categories utilized in this study for the top 20 neighborhoods. This analysis specifically concentrates on crime rate data from the year 2023, aligning with the rationale mentioned earlier.

Downtown Yonge East and Yonge-Bay Corridor emerge prominently as the two areas with the highest crime rates, both recording nearly 0.8% of the population involved in some form of criminal activity. Surprisingly, a noteworthy finding surfaces as four out of the top five neighborhoods with the highest crime rates are located in downtown Toronto, namely Downtown Yonge East, Yonge-Bay Corridor, Moss Park, and Kensington-Chinatown. This observation underscores that downtown Toronto carries the highest crime rate within the city.

# Discussion

\
The analysis of Toronto's crime rate data spanning from 2014 to 2023 provides a comprehensive overview of the city's criminal landscape. Beyond the specific trends identified in the results, it's essential to consider the broader implications and potential policy considerations.

The observed increase in assault and auto theft crimes post-2020 suggests a need for focused interventions and community-based strategies to address these specific challenges. Understanding the dynamics of assault-related incidents becomes paramount, considering its prominence among reported crimes. Effective community policing and engagement initiatives may play a crucial role in curbing these upward trends.

The absence of a clear correlation between population density and most crime categories underscores the multifaceted nature of criminal behavior. While population density alone may not be a reliable predictor of crime rates, the localized patterns in the northwest area suggest that certain neighborhoods face distinct challenges. Tailored strategies for these areas, possibly addressing socio-economic factors and community resources may be essential.

The concentration of high crime rates in downtown Toronto, particularly in neighborhoods like Downtown Yonge East and Yonge-Bay Corridor, prompts a closer examination of urban dynamics. Urban planning and targeted safety measures in these central areas could contribute to a safer urban environment. Understanding the spatial distribution of crime allows for more precise resource allocation and strategic deployment of law enforcement.

In conclusion, the nuanced analysis of Toronto's crime data reveals not only specific trends but also highlights the complexity of factors influencing criminal behavior. While an increase in certain crime categories is evident, Toronto remains relatively safe compare to other cities.
